## CRUD-UserManagement

This is a **User Management App** focusing on **CRUD operations**(create, read, update & delete) created using **NodeJS, ExpressJS** & **MongoDB**. This has a basic functionality of managing user data in form of tables.
We can add a new user, update the data of an existing user, and delete the user completely.

The dynamic rendering of contents is done by **EJS view engine**. The Database used here is **MongoDB Atlas**, connection to which has been established using **Mongoose**. Some of the dependencies used in the project were **NPM, DotEnv, Axios, Morgan & Nodemon.**
